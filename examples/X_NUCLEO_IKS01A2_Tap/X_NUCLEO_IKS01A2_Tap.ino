 * @date    7 September 2017
 * @brief   Arduino test application for the STMicrolectronics X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2
 *          MEMS Inertial and Environmental sensor expansion board.
 *          This application detects tap event through the LSM6DSL sensor.
 *          This application makes use of C++ classes obtained from the C
 *          components' drivers.
